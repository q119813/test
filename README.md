Our consumer culture gives us all sorts of opportunities for entertainment, pleasure 
and  sometimes  even  learning.  However,  by  and  large,  these  are  passive  activities. 
That’s  OK—we  all  like  to  kick  back  sometimes  and  be  entertained—but  it  shouldn’t 
be the whole picture. In addition to the appeal of consuming, there’s the satisfaction 
of producing—that is, of creating. It’s the joy and pride that results when we draw a 
picture, build a model airplane, or bake some bread.
The high-tech objects (like cell phones, tablet computers, TVs, etc.) that we use today 
to consume entertainment and information are black boxes to most of us.  Their work-
ings are incomprehensible and, while there are capabilities in some of them that en -
able the user to draw pictures, make videos, etc., they are not, in and of themselves, 
creative media. In other words, most people can’t create the apps that run on these 
gadgets.
What if we could change that? What if we could take creative control of our everyday 
gadgets, like cell phones? What if building an app for your cell phone was as easy as 
drawing a picture or baking a loaf of bread? What if we could close the gap between 
the objects of our consumer culture and the media of our creative lives?
